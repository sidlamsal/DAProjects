Files:
SummerProject-#.ipynb: Jupyter notebooks with the python code for the project. After trying multiple different methods, I consolidated and picked a path at which point I started a 'fresh' notebook, thus there are 3 ipynb files.
SummerProject.pdf: powerpoint detailing the process and used for weekly meetings with the professor overseeing the research
